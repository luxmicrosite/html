      <h2 id="about-h">About the project</h2>
      <p>The prints in this series were made by etching directly onto different types of film strips: 16&nbsp;mm, 35&nbsp;mm and medium format. The numbers 16 and 35 refer to the width of the film strip. The engraved films were then used as etching plates under a printing press: they were inked to print on Japanese paper and Hahnemühle rag.</p>
      <p>In the drawings, the letters ‘kâf’ (ك), ‘tâ’ (ت) and ‘bâ’ (ب) from the Farsi alphabet appear as morphing—or already morphed—into elements such as a river, a moon, or a flower.</p>
      <p>There are four etching works, described <strong>from right to left</strong> along the wall.</p>

        <p>The fibers of the pale orange paper, soaked for too long before printing, create wave-like patterns on the surface of the print.</p>
        <p>A small window floats in the center. From the window, we contemplate two boats sailing on a pinkish, red river, running and disappearing into the horizon.</p>

        <p>On a large white sheet, two pieces of medium format film are printed, separated by a longer, thinner strip between them. The films’ top and bottom edges are roughly cut.</p>
        <p>Lines connecting across the three film strips depict a chain of mountains, forming a single picture although they stand slightly apart. Under the lowest line, we see seeds buried in soil, figured as small circles enclosing the word “gol” (flower).</p>
        <p>From the seed depicted on the thinner, central shape, a long stem emerges out. A flower has bloomed and glows a yellow haze against the cold blue dominating the rest of the landscape.</p>

        <p>A small off white paper, the same size as the ‘beyond the river’ print. On the right side, two strips of 16&nbsp;mm have been printed in deep green over each other. As in a palimpsest, the marks on the first layer have faded. On the more recent layer, inscribed at the bottom of the film strip, we recognise two dots that hover side by side above a curved horizontal line, forming the letter <em>tâ</em>. The letter is repeated frame by frame, and with each repetition, the two dots move apart, as if pulled by a gravity-defying force. Whilst the dot on the left seeks to join the left top side of the letter’s curve, the dot on the right flies above them.</p>
        <p>Hovering above on the left-hand side of the film strips, we gaze at the now metamorphosed letter <em>tâ</em>. Enclosed in a blue 35&nbsp;mm frame, recognisable by its size and the sprockets on both sides, it is now the image of a small figure, only signified by a few strokes: a circle for the head and two hollow almond shapes for the eyes. Looking up to the sky, they are in conversation with the moon, who is shown as having the same face.</p>

        <p>On the centre of a long, rectangular paper, the print of a 16&nbsp;mm film stands as a flower stem, surrounded by almond-like shapes: two green ones on either sides as leaves, and three red ones above the stem for the petals.</p>
        <p>The stem of the flower is printed in two colours as a gradient. Its base is deep ochre, whilst the other larger half is blue. On this print, the letter ‘bâ’ is etched on the bottom frame of the film, and repeated until it turns into an image. We witness the dot that usually sits at the bottom of the curved line of the letter, grows larger and moves upwards to reach the other side, where it sprouts. The budding plant lengthens and eventually separates from its stem. The circle is now floating alone, but growing in size, we see small almond shapes appearing as eyes and triangles all around, pointing outwards: the sun is now up and shining.</p>
